When I'm Alone

I turned my back 
You were gone in a flash 
Like you always do 
You've always gone off 
Somewhere else 

And when the phone rang 
And I thought it was you 
And I sprung like a kid 
Who just got out of school 
But it's almost 
Always never you 
Never you 

I scream like a child 
My insides went wild 

When I'm alone with you, you make me feel, you make me feel 
When I'm alone with you, you are the one, you are the one 

When I reach out and I only grab air 
And it kills me to think 
That you never did care and it's hopeless 
You've always gone off somewhere else 


And I'm throwing a tantrum 
Why are you such a phantom 

When I'm alone with you, you make me feel, you make me feel 
When I'm alone with you, you are the one, you are the one 

Reminds me of home 
When you're around me 
Next time you leave 
Don't go without me 

no, dont go.. no no...yaaa 

When I'm alone with you, you make me feel, you make me feel 
When I'm alone with you, you are the one, you are the one
